# Mound Simulator Source

Mound Simulator is a derby simulation between a pitcher and a batter in 3-dimensional digital space. You have to complete your inning while not letting the batters run away from a home plate. Use your mouse or finger to drag fast and pitch a baseball. Control a flying ball's trajectory with your creative variations of ball movement.
